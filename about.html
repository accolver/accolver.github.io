## About

I am a full-stack web application developer with expertise in JavaScript. Additionally, I have extensive experience in other languages including Java, C#, C++, Python, and more.

With a degree in <a href="http://bioinformatics.byu.edu/" target="_blank">bioinformatics</a>, I have a love for the life sciences and big data. I am pursuing that passion by working towards a <a href="http://www.heinz.cmu.edu/school-of-information-systems-and-management/information-technology-msit/curriculum/msit-bida/index.aspx" target="_blank">master's degree in information technology</a> with an emphasis in business intelligence and data analytics from the prestigious Carnegie-Mellon University.
